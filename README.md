## Library Support (Coming Soon)

Ravix Terminal will soon be available as an Android library.  
This will allow developers to integrate it directly into their apps with minimal setup.

Example usage will be as simple as:

```kotlin
val terminal = TerminalView(context).apply {
    MainLayout.addView(terminal)
}
```

That's it for integrating Ravix Terminal in Android applications. Its just minimal
setup to get started. It will have rich features that will require some additional configuration,
but the basic setup will be straightforward.
